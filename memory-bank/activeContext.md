# Active Context: Week 4 - SCD Type II Implementation (COMPLETED)

## Current Status: ✅ COMPLETED
Successfully implemented and deployed Slowly Changing Dimensions Type II (SCD Type II) using PySpark on Google Cloud Dataproc.

## Recent Resolution
- **Issue**: Cloud deployment was failing due to argument parsing errors
- **Root Cause**: Script was using manual argument parsing that wasn't correctly handling GCS paths
- **Solution**: 
  - Replaced manual argument parsing with Python `argparse` library
  - Updated test script to use named arguments instead of positional arguments
  - Verified both local and cloud execution work correctly
- **Result**: Successful cloud deployment with Job ID: 9ecbfdf8797f4cada854a2c9b27293af

## Final Implementation Summary
- **Local Testing**: ✅ Working - 14 output records with proper SCD Type II logic
- **Cloud Deployment**: ✅ Working - Successfully deployed to Dataproc
- **Output Verification**: ✅ Cloud results match local test results
- **Documentation**: ✅ Complete with comprehensive README and code comments

## Key Accomplishments
- Complete SCD Type II implementation using DataFrame operations only (no SparkSQL)
- Sample customer master data with realistic change scenarios
- Automated local testing with comprehensive validation
- Google Cloud Dataproc deployment automation
- Production-ready error handling and logging
