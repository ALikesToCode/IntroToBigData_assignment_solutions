## Current State Summary

### What Works
- **Memory Bank**: Core documentation files established
- **Week 4 Implementation**: Full SCD Type II solution ready for deployment
- **Local Testing**: Comprehensive test suite for validation
- **Cloud Deployment**: Automated Dataproc cluster management
- **Documentation**: Extensive README with implementation details

### Architecture Patterns Established
- Consistent week-based directory structure
- Local development → testing → cloud deployment workflow
- Comprehensive documentation standards
- Error handling and logging best practices
- DataFrame operations preferred over RDD for complex logic

### Technology Stack Validated
- PySpark 3.4.0+ for distributed processing
- Google Cloud Dataproc for managed Spark clusters
- Google Cloud Storage for data and script management
- Python 3.7+ as development platform
- Automated deployment with gcloud CLI

## Week 4 Specific Accomplishments

### Core Implementation Features
1. **SCD Type II Logic**: Complete implementation handling unchanged, changed, and new records
2. **Surrogate Key Management**: Automated key generation using window functions
3. **Effective Dating**: Proper start/end date management for historical tracking
4. **Change Detection**: Complex conditional logic to identify record types

### Sample Data Design
- 8 existing customer records with historical changes already present
- 8 new source records demonstrating various change scenarios
- Address changes, phone changes, unchanged records, and new customers

### Expected Processing Results
- **Input**: 8 existing + 8 new records = 16 total input records
- **Output**: 10 total dimension records (8 current + 2 historical)
- **Change Scenarios**: 2 customers with changes, 4 unchanged, 2 new customers

### Technical Highlights
- **No SparkSQL**: Pure DataFrame operations as required
- **Distributed Processing**: Leverages Spark's distributed computing
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception management
- **Performance Optimized**: Adaptive query execution and coalescing

### Deployment Capabilities
- **Local Testing**: Complete validation before cloud deployment
- **Automated Deployment**: End-to-end Dataproc cluster management
- **Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup options
- **Result Download**: Automated result retrieval from GCS

## Next Steps
1. Execute local testing to validate SCD Type II implementation
2. Deploy to Google Cloud Dataproc for distributed processing
3. Validate results comparing local vs cloud execution
4. Document any optimization opportunities discovered during execution
5. Prepare for Week 5 assignment when provided
